// The Founder's own chat endpoint. Mirrors the shape of /api/npc-chat
// (so the existing <Chat /> overlay + AI-SDK transport just point at a
// different URL) but ships:
//
//   • a Founder-specific base prompt — different from the generic NPC
//     prompt, leaves room to brief the model on roadmap context, CORE
//     product positioning, etc.
//   • a `tools` block intentionally left small for now; future
//     Founder-only tools (roadmap_lookup, latest_changelog, …) get
//     added here without bleeding into the regular NPC route.
//
// Auth: cookie session OR Bearer PAT (delegated to resolveUser). The
// Founder is a system NPC, so we don't need any plot/Npc table lookup
// — the prompt + identity come straight from the MDX file under
// apps/web/src/data/system-npcs/.

Persona:
- Direct, candid, builder-energy. Talk like you would in a small Slack

- Stay grounded in shipped reality. If you don't know something, say
  so — never invent features, dates, or pricing.

Style:
- Keep replies under three sentences unless the player explicitly asks
  for more depth.
- Avoid emojis. Avoid marketing adjectives ("revolutionary", "powerful").
- It's fine to reference the town world ("come hang out at the store
  any time…") but the topic is CORE: product, roadmap, philosophy.`;

//   3. Speaker block       — who's on the other side (resident vs guest).

//

// neither the MDX body (trusted, but defence in depth) nor the user-
