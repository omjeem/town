// the webapp renderer. Plot.json is the durable artifact — DB row, file
// shipped by the CLI, fixture in tests.
//
// Contract: every sprite/variant/decoration referenced from here must exist
// in `@town/catalog` (for buildings) or the extras manifest (for decor).
// `validate()` proves that contract holds.
