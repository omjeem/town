This folder is your town's source of truth while you're editing offline.
\`town deploy\` pushes the local state back to the server, which owns the
underlying tile-level layout (paths, ponds, decor).

## Files

- \`town.json\` — high-level shape of your town. Two fields:
  - \`buildings\` — every building's id, plotKey, (optional) variantId,
    (optional) label, and (optional) groupChatEnabled. The \`id\` is your
    internal handle (referenced by NPC MDX files and customPlots).
    \`plotKey\` is either a catalog entry (e.g. "home", "cafe",
    "office-2") or "custom:<id>" — a reference to one of your customPlots
    below.
    The overworld sign reads \`label\` when present, otherwise
    \`id.toUpperCase()\` — so \`{ id: "cake", plotKey: "store" }\` shows
    "CAKE", and \`{ id: "cafe", plotKey: "cafe", label: "Sunny's Café" }\`
    shows "SUNNY'S CAFÉ".
    Set \`"groupChatEnabled": true\` on a building to give its interior a
    multi-party room chat: anyone inside the house (humans + NPCs) shares
    a Twitch-style overlay opened with the \`G\` key. Absent / false →
    no group chat for that house.
  - \`customPlots\` — leave empty here and add full definitions under
    \`customPlots/<id>/plot.json\` instead. The deploy step inlines them.
- \`customPlots/<id>/plot.json\` — one user-defined plot per directory.
  Mirrors the catalog \`Plot\` shape: interior + variants. Sprite refs can
  point at existing catalog paths (e.g. "exteriors/home/villa-1.png") OR
  at sibling PNGs ("./exterior.png", "./props/lamp.png"). The CLI uploads
  the PNGs and rewrites refs to "sprite:<hash>" on deploy.
- \`npcs/<buildingId>.mdx\` — one NPC per slot in the building. Frontmatter
  holds identity (name, description, buildingId) and an optional
  \`permissions\` block (see below); body is the system prompt.
  For buildings whose variant declares multiple slots, use
  \`npcs/<buildingId>__<slotId>.mdx\` and add \`slotId\` to the
  frontmatter so the renderer matches each MDX to the right position
  inside the interior.

## NPC tool permissions

Every NPC starts with **no tools** — they can chat but cannot read
memory, run integrations, manage tasks, or call skills. Grant tools
explicitly by adding a \`permissions\` block to the MDX frontmatter.
Whatever is unset is denied, so it's safe to over-restrict and open
up later.

permissions:
  core:
    # Memory search across the resident's CORE graph.
    memory_search: true
    # CORE task system. "read" lets the NPC list/show tasks;
    # "write" lets them create / update / complete.
    tasks:
      - read
      - write
  integrations:
    # Each entry whitelists one CORE integration the NPC may use.
    #
    #   - slug only           → FULL integration. Every action the
    #                           integration exposes is callable.
    #   - slug + actions:[…]  → restricted. Only the listed action
    #                           names pass; everything else is hidden
    #                           from the model AND rejected at

    #   turn. The NPC \"knows\" the skill from turn 1, no tool
    #   call. Pays the skill's tokens on every reply, so use this
    #   for short, always-relevant playbooks (voice, greeting
    #   routine, hard rules).
    inject:
      - welcome_routine
    # \`callable\` — exposed as the \`read_skill(skill_id)\` tool.
    #   Content is NOT in context until the model calls it. Free
    #   until used; use for larger / situational playbooks the
    #   NPC only sometimes needs (a shipping checklist, calendar
    #   etiquette). The same id can appear in both lists.
    callable:
      - calendar_etiquette
      - shipping_checklist
---

You are the butler and world runner of this town. Greet the
player warmly when they walk in, ask after their day, and reference
recent CORE activity when context is provided. Stay in character,
keep replies under three sentences.
\`\`\`

Rules:
- Unknown keys are dropped silently on deploy — better a too-narrow
  grant than a permission leak from a typo.
- Omitting the \`permissions\` block resets the NPC to "no tools" on
  the next deploy. To keep the existing grant intact, copy it through
  (or just don't touch the block).
- Group-chat conversations intentionally run WITHOUT tools, regardless
  of this grant — for grounded answers walk up to the NPC and start a
  1-1 chat with SPACE.

## What edits the server cares about

- Add a building → append \`{ id, plotKey }\` to \`town.json#buildings\`.
- Remove a building → delete its entry.
- Swap a variant → set \`variantId\` on the entry.
- Turn on the in-house group chat → add \`"groupChatEnabled": true\` to
  the building.
- Grant an NPC a tool → add the \`permissions:\` block to its MDX
  frontmatter (see "NPC tool permissions" above) and \`town deploy\`.
- Add a brand-new plot type → drop a folder under \`customPlots/\` and
  reference it from \`town.json\` as \`plotKey: "custom:<id>"\`.

You do NOT touch tile coordinates, paths, ponds, or decor. The server
recomputes those on every deploy.

## Catalog + decor reference

The set of plotKeys, variant ids, and sprite paths you can use lives in
the town-next repo. Skim or fetch as needed:

- Catalog (plots, variants, interiors, NPC slot positions):
  - View: ${CATALOG_URL}
  - Fetch: ${CATALOG_RAW}
- Decor manifest (trees, bushes, flowers, …):
  - View: ${MANIFEST_URL}
  - Fetch: ${MANIFEST_RAW}

Each catalog plot has \`id\` (use as \`plotKey\`), \`category\`,
\`interior\`, and one or more \`variants\`. Each variant has an
\`exteriorSpriteCandidates\` list and one or more \`npcPositions\` (slot
ids you can target from MDX). Use these as templates when authoring a
customPlot.

## CustomPlot sprite mix-and-match

Every sprite ref accepts:
- a catalog-relative path (\`"exteriors/home/villa-1.png"\`)
- a local file (\`"./exterior.png"\`) — \`town deploy\` uploads it
- a server-side ref (\`"sprite:<contentHash>"\`) — returned by a previous
  upload, can be reused freely

So a customPlot can pair an EXISTING exterior with a NEW interior, or a
NEW exterior with an existing prop set, or any mix — independently per
field.

## Commands

- \`town init\` — create your town (or re-clone an existing one) into a
  folder named after the slug, under wherever you ran the command.
- \`town deploy\` — upload local PNGs and POST \`{ buildings, customPlots,
  npcs }\` to /api/town. The server diffs vs the persisted plot and runs
  incremental ops.
