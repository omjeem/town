The things you care about — fitness, films, art, the side project — turn into
buildings. Locals show up to live in them: a gym coach here, a film critic
there, whoever your world calls for. Give them personalities, plug them into
your tools, then share the address. Friends wander in, meet your locals, bump
into each other — and learn who you are faster than any profile.

## Make it yours

Editing a town is the same as editing a folder. Three steps.

### 1. Log in

```bash
pnpm dlx @redplanethq/town login
```

Pick your CORE host and town server, then authorize in the browser. The
CLI saves a PAT to `~/.town/config.json` (mode 0600).

### 2. Create or clone

```bash
town init
```

This is the only entry point — it decides what to do by asking the server:

- **No town yet?** Prompts for a name and creates one. Folder gets
  scaffolded at `./<slug>/` with the day-zero trio (home / library / store).
- **Town already exists?** Confirms and clones into `./<slug>/` — your
  current buildings, customPlots, and NPC files materialize on disk.

<details>
<summary>What the folder looks like</summary>

```
<slug>/
  town.json           ← buildings list + customPlots references
  customPlots/        ← one folder per user-defined plot
  npcs/               ← one .mdx per NPC (frontmatter = identity, body = prompt)
  catalog.json        ← slim reference of what's available
  manifest.json       ← decor sprite reference
  AGENTS.md           ← orientation for coding agents
```

</details>

### 3. Edit

Everything lives in `<slug>/`. You edit JSON + MDX; the server owns layout.

<details>
<summary><strong>Add, remove, or swap a building</strong></summary>

Open `<slug>/town.json`:

```json
{
  "buildings": [
    { "id": "home",    "plotKey": "home" },
    { "id": "library", "plotKey": "library" },
    { "id": "store",   "plotKey": "store" }
  ],
  "customPlots": []
}
```

- **Add a building** → append `{ "id": "cafe", "plotKey": "cafe" }`.
- **Remove a building** → delete its entry.
- **Swap a variant** → add `"variantId": "cafe.bookshop"`.
- **Rename the sign** → add `"label": "Sunny's Café"`. When omitted the
  sign falls back to `id.toUpperCase()`.

You never write tile coordinates, paths, ponds, or decor. The server
picks a free cell, routes a path from home, refills the surrounding
forest. Re-deploy twice and the same edit lands in the same spot — it's
seeded.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Add or edit an NPC</strong></summary>

NPCs live in `<slug>/npcs/`. A building can host one NPC per **slot** —
the variant declares each slot inside `catalog.json`. The default first
slot is `""` and binds to a plain `<buildingId>.mdx`; named slots use
`<buildingId>__<slotId>.mdx`.

**Find the slots a building supports.** Open `catalog.json`, find the
plot's variant, and read `npcSlots`:

```jsonc
{
  "plotKey": "home",
  "variants": [{
    "id": "home.modern-villa",
    "npcSlots": [
      { "id": "",         "tx": 8, "ty": 3, "label": "warden" },
      { "id": "roommate", "tx": 4, "ty": 5, "label": "roommate" }
    ]
  }]
}
```

That variant has two slots; you can author up to two NPCs at this
building. The empty-string slot is the default; the others are named.

**Single-slot building.** Filename matches the building id; no `slotId`
needed:

```mdx
---
buildingId: cafe
name: Cosma
description: Barista at the cafe. Knows what you're heads-down on.
---

You are the barista at the town cafe. Greet the player warmly when they
walk in and ask what they're heads-down on today. Reference recent CORE
activity when context is provided. Stay in character, never break the
fourth wall, and keep replies under three sentences.
```

**Add an NPC to a specific slot.** Filename is `<buildingId>__<slotId>.mdx`
and the frontmatter pins `slotId`:

```mdx
---
buildingId: home
slotId: roommate
name: Linnea
description: Your roommate at home. Always halfway through a novel.
---

You are the roommate at home. Greet the player like family — warm but
unfussy. Bring up books when natural, never lecture. Stay in character;
keep replies under three sentences.
```

If the variant doesn't list the slot id you're trying to use, the
server has nowhere to render it. For a fully custom layout — your own
exterior, interior, and multiple NPC positions — declare the slots in
a `customPlots/<id>/plot.json` (see *Bring your own building* below)
and reference the new `plotKey: "custom:<id>"` from `town.json`.

**Change an NPC's prompt or identity.** Open the `.mdx` and edit:

- The **body** is the system prompt the LLM reads on every turn — this
  is where voice and behavior live.
- `name` is the speaker line on the chat bubble.
- `description` is the flavor text shown when the player walks up.

Then run `town deploy` from the slug folder. The server replaces the
entire NPC roster atomically — no half-deployed state, no orphan rows
left behind from deleted buildings.

**Prompt conventions that age well**

- Lead with role and place: *"You are the barista at the town cafe."*
- Anchor the voice in one sentence: tone, what they care about, how
  they greet.
- Tell the model what context it'll get. If you read CORE signals into
  the prompt at runtime, say so — *"reference recent CORE activity when
  context is provided"*.
- Cap length: *"keep replies under three sentences"*. Without this the
  model drifts long and the chat bubble runs off the screen.
- Lock the frame: *"stay in character, never break the fourth wall"*.

</details>

### 4. Deploy

```bash
cd <slug>
town deploy
```

Uploads any new PNGs (see below), then POSTs `{ buildings, customPlots,
npcs }` to `/api/town`. The server diffs against your persisted plot and
runs incremental layout ops — no full regenerations, no churn on
untouched buildings.

---

## Bring your own building

If the catalog doesn't have what you want, define a `customPlot`. Mirror
the catalog's shape: an interior shell + props + one or more exterior
variants. Reference it from `town.json` as `"plotKey": "custom:<id>"`.

Every sprite field accepts one of three ref types — **independently per
field** — so you can pair an existing catalog exterior with a custom
interior, a custom exterior with the catalog's prop set, or any mix:

| Looks like | Means | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `"exteriors/home/villa-1.png"` | Existing catalog asset | `/sprites/catalog/` |
| `"./exterior.png"` | Local PNG in your customPlot folder | `town deploy` uploads it |
| `"sprite:abc123…"` | Previously uploaded asset | `/api/sprites/<hash>.png` |

Open `catalog.json` in your folder — `exteriorSprites`, `interiorSprites`,
`propSprites` list every catalog path you can reuse.

  "label": "Record Store",
  "category": "MARKET",
  "interior": {
    "sprite": "./interior.png",
    "widthTiles": 14,
    "heightTiles": 13,
    "walkable":   { "tx": 1, "ty": 2, "w": 12, "h": 9 },
    "spawn":      { "tx": 7, "ty": 11 },
    "exit":       { "tx": 7, "ty": 12 },
    "props": [
      { "tx": 4, "ty": 3, "sprite": "./props/crate.png" },
      { "tx": 6, "ty": 3, "sprite": "props/lamp-standing.png" }
    ]
  },
  "variants": [
    {
      "id": "record-store.classic",
      "exteriorSprite": "./exterior.png",
      "npcPositions": [
        { "id": "",        "tx": 5, "ty": 4, "label": "shopkeep" },
        { "id": "regular", "tx": 7, "ty": 6, "label": "regular" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

A variant must declare at least one slot via either `npcPosition`
(legacy singular) or `npcPositions` (multi-slot array). The example
above uses `npcPositions`, so authoring two MDX files — `record-store.mdx`
for the empty-string slot and `record-store__regular.mdx` for the named
one — gives your record store both a shopkeep and a regular.

<details>
<summary>What happens on deploy</summary>

The CLI walks every sprite ref, uploads each local PNG to `/api/sprites`
(PNG-only, 1 MiB cap, content-addressed in Postgres), and rewrites the
ref to `sprite:<hash>` before sending. Re-deploying is free — hashes that
already exist are no-ops.

Then open <http://localhost:3001>. `.env` lives at the repo root;
`apps/web/.env` is a symlink so Next picks it up, and `@town/db` scripts
load it via `dotenv-cli`.

| `pnpm dev` | `turbo run dev` — starts the web app |
| `pnpm build` | Production build of every package |
| `pnpm typecheck` | `tsc --noEmit` across the monorepo |
| `pnpm lint` | Lint every package |
| `pnpm db:migrate` | `prisma migrate dev` in `@town/db` |

| `pnpm db:studio` | Open Prisma Studio |
| `pnpm plot:build-default` | Regenerate the committed default plot |

The event worker (BullMQ consumer for CORE webhooks) runs separately:

```bash
pnpm --filter @town/web run worker

<details>
<summary>Auth &amp; CORE integration</summary>

CORE OAuth2 + PKCE. The browser only ever sees an opaque session cookie
(`core-town:sid`); access and refresh tokens live in the `Session` table.
The `town` CLI authenticates with a CORE PAT instead — every API route
that accepts cookies also accepts `Authorization: Bearer <pat>`.

- Client entry points: `apps/web/src/game/auth.ts`
- Server endpoints: `apps/web/src/app/api/auth/{login,callback,me,logout}/route.ts`
- CORE wire calls: `apps/web/src/lib/oauth.ts`
- Session bookkeeping + refresh: `apps/web/src/lib/session.ts`

To call CORE from a Route Handler, read the session id from the cookie,
resolve a fresh access token via `getAccessTokenForSession(sid)`, then:

```ts
fetch(`${CORE_OAUTH_BASE}/api/v1/...`, {
  headers: { authorization: `Bearer ${token}` },
});
```

Inbound webhooks land at `/api/events` and are HMAC-verified against
`TOWN_WEBHOOK_SECRET` (`X-Town-Signature: sha256(secret, rawBody)`).
